# hometown-project
## Hometown Project
This was my first solo project from Scrimba's Front End Development Career Path. I created a landing page for visiting my hometown in Beijing, China.
I coded with HTML and CSS, and also learned how to use Figma as a developer. I loosely based my page on a Figma design file with suggested specs.

There is a placeholder JS file in the folder, as I may return to this project and add Javascript as I learn additional material.
