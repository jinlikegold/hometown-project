            <h2>About Qinghuayuan</h2>
            <p>Beijing is famous for many attractions, though if you want a quieter day away from tourist crowds, you may consider stopping by the Haidian district surrounding renowned Qinghua University. The school itself hosts students from all over China and internationally, but the surrounding neighborhoods are lesser known. Majestic architecture, lush gardens, and a peaceful community can be found here.</p>
